# HousePricesPrediction
<p>This notebook is my answer to the Kaggle's HousePricesPrediction challenge. </p>

You can access the webpage of the challenge here [challenge here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

First, I perform data wrangling, transforming variables and handling formats and missing values. Then, I apply TensorFlow neural networks and compare them with random forest.
The random forest algorithm yields more accuracy.
